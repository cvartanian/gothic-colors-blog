Maybe you picture ornate stone architecture of a castle or a cathedra with gargoyles. Or perhaps foreboding skies rolling over said castle.

    "About a year ago, [Caroline Winter](https://carolinewinter.com/), a PhD student at the University of Victoria, emailed me with a question.  She had assembled a [corpus of 134 works of European Gothic literature](https://github.com/eleanorstrib/gothic/tree/master/corpora) that had been written or translated into English, ranging from the 18th century to the early 20th.  Could I write her a short script to count and analyze color words for a broad corpus she’d assembled as a survey of Gothic literature she was studying?  Because her hunch was that gothic literature was greener and less bleak and grim than most people thought.\n",

    "Next, we needed to isolate the color words from the text and do some analysis of the context to make sure there weren’t any glaring issues in the data we were generating.  Here Caroline’s literature background was extremely helpful in identifying what looked off, and I went off to pull out the context of the suspicious words so she could make a final call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of words we eliminated based on context were:\n",
    "Isabella, a yellowish color that was also the name of a couple of characters in our corpus;\n",
    "Imperial, a purple color that, in the texts actually meant the political structure, not the color; and\n",
    "Angry, sometimes used to describe a red-pink flushed color, but was used more an an emotion word than a color word.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, I also experimented with stemming and lemmatization of the color words in our master list and in the texts themselves to see if that changed how many color words we were finding, rather than looking for exact matches.  What this means, for example, is transforming the word “whitish” from the OEDHT to its root, or stem (“white”) and doing the same to the words in the text we were analyzing. However, because the OEDHT is so comprehensive and already included many forms of each word, the results didn’t change much so we left out that step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the preliminary data, we also found that we got some combinations of color words, like “rose” followed by “red” or “milky” followed by “white”.  While OEDHT covers common combinations of these when they’re joined with a “-” (e.g. “rose-red”) we decided to isolate those examples in the output of the `find_color_words` to help us determine if we wanted to exclude those samples from the final analysis.\n"
